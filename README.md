# Day 1

On this first day of x days of data I started easy by doing some [Meta Learning](https://webbswideworld.com/2019/09/09/the-principles-of-ultralearning-1-metalearning/), inspired by [#66DaysOfData](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I).

# Day 2 & 3

Working on [Music Genre Recognition APP](https://github.com/Flor91/digital-house-challenge-3), 
a FastAPI app that recognizes music genres based on an Spotify URI.

Technologies used:
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification): (ex. Swagger) The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. 
- [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/): Starlette is a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high performance asyncio services.
- [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/): Data validation and settings management using python type annotations.
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/): SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
- [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/): modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modelled after Django‚Äôs templates. 
- [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/): world‚Äôs most popular front-end open source toolkit, featuring Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful JavaScript plugins.

For data processing:
- [Librosa](https://librosa.org/): Audio and music processing with Python
- [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.1/): lightweight Python library for the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). 
- [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub):  Manipulate audio with a simple and easy high level interface
