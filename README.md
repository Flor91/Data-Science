# Days of Data

This is my journey into x days of data, where I will learn about Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning technologies.

I won't be committing to an exact number of days or to working on this every day - not even for 5 minutes, sorry - because of life (I am expecting a baby boy!).

But I encourage anyone interested on this challenge to follow the rules set up by [#66DaysOfData](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I).

## Day 1

On this first day of x days of data I started easy by doing some [Meta Learning](https://webbswideworld.com/2019/09/09/the-principles-of-ultralearning-1-metalearning/).

### 1 - Watched some Youtube videos:
- [Step By Step Action Plan For Learning Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP1hb4BFAWA&t=2s) By [Krish Naik](https://www.youtube.com/user/krishnaik06)
- [How I would learn data science in 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Clrh6nv1s) By [Ken Jee](https://www.youtube.com/c/KenJee1)
- [How to ULTRALEARN Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3VWq9smqhM)
- [The 5 Stages of Learning Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpMc6TgT34I)

### 2 - Completed [Kaggle's Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) course
Review Python concepts needed for Data Science and Machine learning.

### 3 - Started [Kaggle's Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) course

Learn the core ideas in machine learning, and build my first models.
   1. How models work
   2. Basic Data Exploration
   3. First ML Model
   4. Model Validation
   5. Underfitting and Overfitting
   6. Random Forest
   7. ML Competitions

### Notes
#### Learning Data Science Roadmap 🛣️
1. Programming Language
    - Select one (Python, R, Java...) I will work with Python.
    - Data Structures, Functions, OOPS, Exception handling, List comprehension, external libraries
2. Python Libraries to work with complex data structures
    - Numpy
    - Pandas
3. Statistics and Probability
    - Basic concepts: Mean, Median, Mode...
    - Distributions: Normal, Standard, ...
4. Visualization
    - MatplotLib
    - Seaborn
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Feature engineering
    - Cleaning data
    - Data formating, Normalization: Scalers
6. Machine Learning algorithms
    - understand theory and concepts behind each of the top 20 basic algorithms
7. Deployment
    - AWS, GCP, Heroku
    - Flask, FastAPI, Django
    - Docker, Kubernetes
8. Deep Learning
     - 3 basic Neural Algos: Aritifical(ANN),Convolutional(CNN) & Recurrent(RNN)
     - TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch
9. Databases:
     - SQL for structured data
     - MongoDB for unstructured data
10. Visualization:
     - PowerBI
     - Tableau
     - Qlik Sense

## Day 2 & 3

Working on [Music Genre Recognition APP](https://github.com/Flor91/digital-house-challenge-3), 
a FastAPI app that recognizes music genres based on an Spotify URI.

#### Technologies used:
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification): (ex. Swagger) The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. 
- [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/): Starlette is a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high performance asyncio services.
- [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/): Data validation and settings management using python type annotations.
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/): SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
- [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/): modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modelled after Django’s templates. 
- [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/): world’s most popular front-end open source toolkit, featuring Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful JavaScript plugins.

#### For data processing:
- [Librosa](https://librosa.org/): Audio and music processing with Python
- [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.1/): lightweight Python library for the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). 
- [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub):  Manipulate audio with a simple and easy high level interface
